- ```preprocess-metabolome.py``` Filters raw baseline and end metabolite concentrations to remove samples measured at only one timestamp, metabolites with too many missing values, and imputes the remaining missing values.
- ```preprocess-human-gem.py``` Filters Human-GEM to produce the 9 reaction sets.
- ```compute-change-feature.py``` Calculates the proposed 'Change' features with preprocessed metabolome and a given reaction set.
- ```compute-ratio-feature.py``` Calculates the proposed 'Ratio' features with preprocessed metabolome and a given reaction set.
- ```compute-prob-feature.py``` Calculates the proposed 'Prob' features with preprocessed metabolome and a given reaction set.
- ```classification.py``` Performs hyperparameter tuning and classification using random forests with a given feature matrix.
- ```preprocess-and-compute-features.py``` Preprocesses metabolomic profiles and Human-GEM, computes features integrating these two processed sources.
